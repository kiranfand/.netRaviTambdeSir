
Hi Welcome to .NET revision in TAP. 
We have started applying concepts of .net in Project. But somehow  forgot to revise our learnings. Without  theroy there is no practical. Theory explains concepts. Practical confirms concept clarity, understanding in do it your self mode. We have to keep both  going in hand in hand.

Let us revise Basics and essential before we move to next orbit of learning and applying .NET.

## .NET Core CLI Commands

The ".NET CLI" (Command Line Interface) is a set of command-line tools provided by Microsoft for working with .NET Core and .NET 5/6 applications. It allows you to build, run, test, and manage .NET applications directly from the command line. Here are some common commands:

1. `dotnet new`: Creates a new .NET project or file.
2. `dotnet restore`: Restores the dependencies and tools of a project.
3. `dotnet build`: Builds a .NET project.
4. `dotnet run`: Runs a .NET project.
5. `dotnet test`: Runs unit tests in a .NET project.
6. `dotnet publish`: Publishes a .NET project for deployment.
7. `dotnet clean`: Cleans the output of a .NET project.
8. `dotnet pack`: Packs the project into a NuGet package.

These are just a few examples. To get a full list of available commands and their options, you can use the `dotnet --help` command or refer to the official Microsoft documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/

## Console applications and Class Libraries

In .NET Core, both console applications and class libraries serve distinct purposes and have different characteristics. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

1. **Console Application**:
   - **Purpose**: Console applications are standalone executables designed to be run from the command line. They typically provide a text-based interface for interacting with the user or performing background tasks.
   - **Entry Point**: Console applications have a `Main` method as their entry point, which is automatically executed when the application starts.
   - **User Interaction**: Console applications interact with the user via the command-line interface (CLI), accepting input from the user and displaying output in the console window.
   - **Execution Environment**: Console applications are executed directly by the operating system and can be run on various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.
   - **Example**: A command-line tool for file manipulation, data processing, or system administration.

2. **Class Library**:
   - **Purpose**: Class libraries are reusable components that encapsulate functionality for use by other applications. They contain classes, interfaces, enums, and other types but do not have an entry point like console applications.
   - **Reusability**: Class libraries promote code reuse by providing a collection of related functionality that can be referenced and used by multiple applications or projects.
   - **No Entry Point**: Class libraries do not have a `Main` method or an entry point because they are not executable on their own. They are meant to be referenced and used by other applications, such as console applications, web applications, or desktop applications.
   - **Packaging**: Class libraries are typically packaged as DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files, which contain compiled code that can be dynamically linked to other applications at runtime.
   - **Example**: A library for performing mathematical calculations, accessing a database, or implementing business logic that can be reused across multiple projects.

In summary, console applications are standalone executables designed for direct execution from the command line, while class libraries are reusable components meant to be referenced and used by other applications. The choice between them depends on whether you need a standalone application with a user interface (console application) or a reusable set of functionality (class library) that can be used by multiple applications.



## Console applications and Web Applications
In .NET Core, console applications and web applications serve different purposes and are designed for different types of use cases. Here's a comparison between the two:

1. **Console Application**:
   - **Purpose**: Console applications are command-line based programs that run in a terminal or command prompt. They are typically used for tasks such as batch processing, system administration, automation, or for building command-line tools.
   - **Interaction**: Console applications interact with the user through text-based input and output. They accept input from the user via command-line arguments or prompts and provide output through the console window.
   - **Entry Point**: Console applications have a `Main` method as their entry point, which is automatically executed when the application starts.
   - **Examples**: Utilities for file manipulation, data processing scripts, system administration tools, or command-line interface (CLI) applications.

2. **Web Application**:
   - **Purpose**: Web applications are designed to be accessed and used through web browsers over HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). They provide interactive user interfaces and can handle requests from multiple users concurrently.
   - **Interaction**: Web applications interact with users through web browsers, presenting HTML pages with forms, buttons, and other user interface elements. They accept user input through web forms, HTTP requests, or AJAX calls and generate dynamic content as responses.
   - **Entry Point**: Web applications typically have a `Startup` class that configures the application's services and middleware. The entry point for web applications is often the `Main` method in the `Program` class, which sets up the web host and starts the application.
   - **Examples**: Websites, web portals, web-based applications, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), web services, etc.

**Key Differences**:

- **User Interface**: Console applications have a text-based interface suitable for batch processing and automation, while web applications have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) accessible through web browsers.
- **Concurrency**: Web applications are designed to handle multiple concurrent requests from different users, while console applications typically run in a single-threaded fashion and handle one task at a time.
- **Deployment**: Console applications are usually deployed as standalone executables, while web applications are deployed to web servers (e.g., IIS, Kestrel) and accessed over the internet.
- **Interactivity**: Web applications provide interactive user interfaces with rich features like forms, buttons, and client-side scripting, while console applications have limited interactivity through text-based input and output.

In summary, the choice between a console application and a web application depends on the intended use case, user interface requirements, and deployment environment. Console applications are suitable for automation, system administration, and batch processing tasks, while web applications are ideal for building interactive web-based applications accessed through web browsers.


## What is ASP.NET  Core?

ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. It's an open-source web framework developed by Microsoft and it's a significant redesign of the original ASP.NET framework.

Here are some key features and components of ASP.NET Core:

1. **Cross-platform**: ASP.NET Core applications can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. **Modular**: ASP.NET Core is modular and lightweight, allowing developers to include only the necessary components in their applications, reducing the overhead.

You can find extensive documentation and tutorials on the official ASP.NET Core website: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/apis


## Basics of C# Programming

Certainly! Here's an overview of some basic concepts in C#:

1. **Variables and Data Types**:
   - Variables are containers for storing data.
   - C# is a statically typed language, meaning you must declare the data type of a variable before using it.
   - Common data types include `int`, `float`, `double`, `string`, `bool`, etc.

   Example:
   ```csharp
   int age = 30;
   string name = "John";
   double height = 6.2;
   bool isAdult = true;
   ```

2. **Operators**:
   - C# supports various operators like arithmetic, comparison, logical, etc.
   - Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
   - Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
   - Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`.

3. **Control Structures**:
   - `if` statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
   - `else` statement: Executes a block of code if the same condition is false.
   - `else if` statement: Allows you to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
   - `switch` statement: Evaluates an expression and executes the matching case.

   Example:
   ```csharp
   int num = 10;
   if (num > 0)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Positive number");
   }
   else if (num < 0)
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Negative number");
   }
   else
   {
       Console.WriteLine("Zero");
   }
   ```

4. **Loops**:
   - `for` loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
   - `while` loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
   - `do-while` loop: Similar to `while` loop, but the condition is evaluated after executing the block of code, so it's guaranteed to execute at least once.

   Example:
   ```csharp
   for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
   {
       Console.WriteLine(i);
   }

   int j = 0;
   while (j < 5)
   {
       Console.WriteLine(j);
       j++;
   }
   ```

5. **Arrays**:
   - Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same data type.
   - Arrays have a fixed size which is specified at the time of declaration.

   Example:
   ```csharp
   int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
   ```

6. **Methods**:
   - Methods are blocks of code that perform a specific task.
   - They can have parameters and return a value.

   Example:
   ```csharp
   int Add(int a, int b)
   {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

These are some fundamental concepts in C#. Understanding them will provide you with a solid foundation for further learning and development in C#.


## Object Oriented Programming using C#

Certainly! Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects, which can contain data (attributes or properties) and code (methods or functions). In C#, OOP is extensively used, and here are some essential concepts:

1. **Classes and Objects**:
   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors common to all objects of that type.
   - An object is an instance of a class. It has its own state (data) and behavior (methods).
   
   Example:
   ```csharp
   class Car
   {
       public string Make;
       public string Model;
       public int Year;

       public void Start()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Engine started");
       }
   }

   Car myCar = new Car();
   myCar.Make = "Toyota";
   myCar.Model = "Camry";
   myCar.Year = 2022;
   myCar.Start();  // Output: Engine started
   ```

2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).
   - It helps in data hiding and abstraction, allowing objects to interact with each other through well-defined interfaces.

3. **Inheritance**:
   - Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class.
   - The class that inherits is called a derived class or subclass, and the class from which it inherits is called a base class or superclass.

   Example:
   ```csharp
   class Vehicle
   {
       public string Make;
       public string Model;
       public int Year;
   }

   class Car : Vehicle
   {
       public void Start()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Engine started");
       }
   }
   ```

   <hr/>

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
   - It enables methods to be overridden in derived classes, allowing for different implementations of the same method signature.

   Example:
   ```csharp
   class Animal
   {
       public virtual void MakeSound()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog : Animal
   {
       public override void MakeSound()
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Abstraction**:
   - Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
   - Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction in C#.

6. **Access Modifiers**:
   - Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and other members.
   - Common access modifiers include `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `internal`.

7. **Constructor and Destructor**:
   - Constructors are special methods that are invoked when an object is created. They initialize the object's state.
   - Destructors are used to perform cleanup operations before an object is destroyed.

These are some essential concepts in C# object-oriented programming. Understanding and applying these concepts will enable you to write more organized, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Collections in C#

In C#, the .NET framework provides a rich set of collection classes and interfaces in the `System.Collections` and `System.Collections.Generic` namespaces. These collections offer various data structures to store and manipulate groups of related objects efficiently. Here are some commonly used collection types:

1. **Arrays**:
   - Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements of the same type.
   - They offer fast access to elements using an index but have a fixed size.

   ```csharp
   int[] numbers = new int[5]; // Array of integers with size 5
   ```

2. **List\<T>**:
   - List<T> is a dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size.
   - It provides methods to add, remove, and access elements by index.

   ```csharp
   List<int> numbers = new List<int>(); // List of integers
   numbers.Add(10);
   numbers.Add(20);
   ```

3. **Dictionary\<TKey, TValue>**:
   - Dictionary<TKey, TValue> stores key-value pairs.
   - It provides fast lookup based on keys.

   ```csharp
   Dictionary<string, int> scores = new Dictionary<string, int>(); // Dictionary of string keys and integer values
   scores["John"] = 90;
   scores["Alice"] = 85;
   ```

4. **HashSet\<T>**:
   - HashSet<T> stores unique elements, eliminating duplicates.
   - It provides set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

   ```csharp
   HashSet<int> set = new HashSet<int>(); // HashSet of integers
   set.Add(10);
   set.Add(20);
   ```

5. **Queue\<T>**:
   - Queue<T> represents a first-in, first-out (FIFO) collection.
   - It provides methods for enqueueing (adding) and dequeueing (removing) elements.

   ```csharp
   Queue<string> queue = new Queue<string>(); // Queue of strings
   queue.Enqueue("Alice");
   queue.Enqueue("Bob");
   ```

6. **Stack\<T>**:
   - Stack<T> represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) collection.
   - It provides methods for pushing (adding) and popping (removing) elements.

   ```csharp
   Stack<int> stack = new Stack<int>(); // Stack of integers
   stack.Push(10);
   stack.Push(20);
   ```

7. **LinkedList\<T>**:
   - LinkedList<T> represents a doubly linked list.
   - It provides efficient insertion and removal of elements.

   ```csharp
   LinkedList<int> linkedList = new LinkedList<int>(); // Linked list of integers
   linkedList.AddLast(10);
   linkedList.AddLast(20);
   ```

These are some of the commonly used collection types in C#. Depending on your requirements, you can choose the appropriate collection to efficiently store and manipulate data in your applications.

## Why Interfaces ?

Interfaces in C# are powerful tools that enable you to define contracts for classes to implement. They provide a way to define a set of members (methods, properties, events, or indexers) that implementing classes must adhere to. Here are some reasons why interfaces are used in C#:

1. **Abstraction**:
   - Interfaces allow you to define a contract without providing any implementation details.
   - They help in abstracting the behavior or functionality required by different classes.

2. **Multiple Inheritance**:
   - C# does not support multiple inheritance of classes, meaning a class cannot inherit from more than one class.
   - However, a class can implement multiple interfaces.
   - Interfaces enable a form of multiple inheritance by allowing a class to inherit behavior from multiple sources.

3. **Decoupling and Loose Coupling**:
   - Interfaces promote loose coupling between components in an application.
   - When classes depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations, they are less tightly bound to specific implementations.
   - This allows for easier maintenance, testing, and refactoring as implementations can be swapped without affecting clients of the interface.

4. **Polymorphism**:
   - Interfaces support polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly based on their common interface.
   - This facilitates writing code that can work with different implementations of the same interface without needing to know the specific implementation details.

5. **Design by Contract**:
   - Interfaces help in implementing the "design by contract" principle, where classes agree to adhere to a specific contract defined by an interface.
   - Clients of the interface can rely on the contract, ensuring that implementing classes provide the necessary functionality.

6. **Framework Design**:
   - Interfaces are commonly used in framework design to define standard APIs that multiple classes can implement.
   - This promotes consistency and interoperability across different parts of the framework or library.

7. **Testing and Mocking**:
   - Interfaces facilitate unit testing by allowing for the creation of mock objects that implement the same interface.
   - This makes it easier to isolate and test individual components of an application.

8. **Code Reusability**:
   - Interfaces promote code reusability by allowing different classes to share common behavior defined by the interface.
   - By designing classes to implement interfaces, you can create modular and reusable components.

In summary, interfaces play a crucial role in C# development by enabling abstraction, decoupling, polymorphism, and code reusability. They are essential for building flexible, maintainable, and extensible software systems.


## Loosely Coupled , Highly Cohesive  Solutions

In software engineering, the concepts of "loosely coupled" and "highly cohesive" refer to the design principles aimed at creating maintainable, modular, and scalable software systems. Let's discuss how these principles can be applied in the context of .NET Core development:

1. **Loosely Coupled**:

   Loosely coupled systems have components that are independent of each other, meaning changes in one component don't directly affect others. This promotes flexibility, reusability, and easier maintenance. In .NET Core development, you can achieve loose coupling through various techniques:

   - **Dependency Injection (DI)**: .NET Core provides built-in support for dependency injection, allowing you to inject dependencies into classes rather than creating them directly within the class. This promotes loose coupling by decoupling the creation of dependencies from their usage.

   - **Interfaces**: By programming to interfaces rather than concrete implementations, you can decouple components from specific implementations. This allows for easy substitution of implementations without changing the client code.

   - **Event-driven Architecture**: Implementing event-driven architectures using features like delegates and events in C# allows components to communicate with each other without direct dependencies. This reduces coupling and promotes modularity.

   - **Message Queues and Pub/Sub**: Using messaging patterns such as message queues or publish-subscribe mechanisms can decouple components by allowing them to communicate asynchronously through messages.

2. **Highly Cohesive**:

   Highly cohesive systems have components that are focused and perform a specific set of tasks related to a single responsibility. High cohesion promotes maintainability, readability, and understanding of the codebase. In .NET Core development, you can achieve high cohesion through:

   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Following the SRP from SOLID principles, each class should have only one reason to change. This ensures that classes are highly cohesive, focusing on a single responsibility.

   - **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating related functionality within classes ensures that each class has a clear purpose and focuses on a specific area of functionality.

   - **Domain-driven Design (DDD)**: DDD promotes the organization of code around the domain model, ensuring that classes are cohesive by encapsulating behavior and data related to specific domain concepts.

   - **Modular Design**: Breaking down a system into smaller, modular components based on functionality or business domains promotes high cohesion. Each module should encapsulate related functionality, making it easier to understand and maintain.

By adhering to these principles, .NET Core developers can build robust, maintainable, and scalable applications that are flexible to change and easy to understand. These principles promote clean architecture, which is essential for long-term success in software development.


In .NET Core, connecting to databases is a common requirement for many applications. .NET Core provides various libraries and frameworks for interacting with different types of databases, including relational databases like SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Here's how you can connect to databases in C# using .NET Core:


<hr/>
## Database Connectivity

1. **ADO.NET**:
   
   ADO.NET is the traditional way of interacting with databases in .NET. It provides a set of classes and interfaces in the `System.Data` namespace for connecting to, querying, and manipulating databases.

   Example using SQL Server:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Data.SqlClient;

   class Program
   {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           string connectionString = "Server=localhost;Database=myDatabase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;";
           using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
           {
               connection.Open();
               // Perform database operations
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Entity Framework Core**:

   Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database access by allowing you to work with databases using strongly-typed .NET objects.

   Example using EF Core with SQL Server:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

   class MyDbContext : DbContext
   {
       public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }

       protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
       {
           optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=myDatabase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;");
       }
   }

   class Customer
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }
       public string Name { get; set; }
   }

   class Program
   {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           using (var context = new MyDbContext())
           {
               // Perform database operations using EF Core
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Dapper**:

   Dapper is a micro-ORM library that provides simple object mapping for relational databases. It's lightweight and faster compared to full-fledged ORMs like Entity Framework Core.

   Example using Dapper with SQL Server:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Data.SqlClient;
   using Dapper;

   class Program
   {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           string connectionString = "Server=localhost;Database=myDatabase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;";
           using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
           {
               connection.Open();
               var customers = connection.Query<Customer>("SELECT * FROM Customers");
               // Process the retrieved customers
           }
       }
   }
   ```

These are just a few examples of how you can connect to databases in C# using .NET Core. Depending on your requirements and preferences, you can choose the appropriate approach and libraries for database connectivity in your application.

## Connected Data Access and Disconnected Data Access


In C#, when working with databases, you'll often come across two main approaches: connected data access and disconnected data access. Each approach has its advantages and is suitable for different scenarios. Let's explore both:

1. **Connected Data Access**:

   In connected data access, the connection to the database remains open while interacting with the data. This approach is typically used for short-lived operations where data needs to be retrieved, processed, and updated in real-time. It's commonly implemented using techniques like ADO.NET's `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, `SqlDataReader`, etc.

   Example using connected data access with ADO.NET:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Data.SqlClient;

   class Program
   {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           string connectionString = "Server=localhost;Database=myDatabase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;";
           using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
           {
               connection.Open();
               string sql = "SELECT * FROM Customers";
               using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection))
               {
                   using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
                   {
                       while (reader.Read())
                       {
                           // Process each row
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   **Advantages**:
   - Suitable for real-time operations where immediate access to the database is required.
   - More control over database transactions and operations.
   - Efficient for small to medium-sized datasets.

   **Disadvantages**:
   - Requires an open connection to the database, which can lead to resource contention and scalability issues.
   - Not suitable for long-lived operations or applications with large datasets.

2. **Disconnected Data Access**:

   In disconnected data access, data is retrieved from the database, processed, and then the connection to the database is closed. The data is then manipulated locally, and changes are later reconciled with the database. This approach is commonly used in scenarios where data needs to be cached locally, manipulated offline, or when dealing with large datasets.

   Example using disconnected data access with ADO.NET's `DataSet` and `DataAdapter`:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Data;
   using System.Data.SqlClient;

   class Program
   {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           string connectionString = "Server=localhost;Database=myDatabase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;";
           using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
           {
               SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM Customers", connection);
               DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();
               adapter.Fill(dataSet, "Customers");

               // Process data locally
               DataTable customersTable = dataSet.Tables["Customers"];
               foreach (DataRow row in customersTable.Rows)
               {
                   // Process each row
               }

               // Make changes to the dataset

               // Update changes to the database
               SqlCommandBuilder builder = new SqlCommandBuilder(adapter);
               adapter.Update(dataSet, "Customers");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   **Advantages**:
   - Reduced load on the database server as connections are short-lived.
   - Suitable for scenarios where data needs to be manipulated offline or cached locally.
   - Improved scalability and performance for applications dealing with large datasets.

   **Disadvantages**:
   - Requires careful management of changes to ensure consistency between the local dataset and the database.
   - Complex synchronization logic may be needed for reconciling changes with the database.

Both connected and disconnected data access approaches have their place in C# development, and the choice between them depends on factors such as application requirements, scalability, performance, and data size.

## ASP.NET CORE  Web API

ASP.NET Core Web API is a framework for building HTTP-based services using the ASP.NET Core platform. It enables developers to create RESTful APIs that can be consumed by various clients, such as web browsers, mobile apps, or other services. ASP.NET Core Web API provides a flexible and lightweight approach to building APIs, allowing developers to focus on defining endpoints, handling requests, and returning responses without the overhead of traditional MVC applications.

Key features of ASP.NET Core Web API include:

1. **Controller-based Routing**: ASP.NET Core Web API uses controllers to define endpoints and handle HTTP requests. Controllers are classes that inherit from ControllerBase or ApiController and contain action methods corresponding to different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and routes.

2. **Attribute Routing**: ASP.NET Core Web API supports attribute-based routing, where routes are defined directly on controller action methods using attributes like `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, `[Route]`, etc. This provides a more concise and declarative way to define routes compared to convention-based routing.

3. **Model Binding and Validation**: ASP.NET Core Web API automatically binds incoming request data to action method parameters based on the request content (e.g., JSON, XML, form data). It also provides built-in model validation to ensure that request data meets specified validation rules.

4. **Content Negotiation**: ASP.NET Core Web API supports content negotiation, allowing clients to request data in different formats (e.g., JSON, XML) using standard HTTP headers like `Accept` and `Content-Type`. It can automatically serialize response data to the requested format based on client preferences.

5. **Dependency Injection**: ASP.NET Core Web API leverages the built-in dependency injection (DI) container to manage dependencies and services. This enables developers to inject services into controllers and other components, promoting modularity, testability, and maintainability.

6. **Middleware Pipeline**: ASP.NET Core Web API uses the ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline to handle HTTP requests and responses. Developers can configure middleware components to perform various tasks such as authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, and more.

7. **Built-in Support for Formats and Protocols**: ASP.NET Core Web API includes built-in support for popular formats and protocols, such as JSON, XML, Swagger/OpenAPI for documentation, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and HTTPS.

ASP.NET Core Web API is a versatile framework that can be used to build a wide range of HTTP-based services, including RESTful APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and gRPC services. It provides a unified programming model, robust tooling, and built-in features to simplify the process of building modern, scalable, and interoperable APIs.




## ASP.NET CORE Program.cs file
In an ASP.NET Core application, the `Program.cs` file plays a crucial role in configuring and bootstrapping the application. It serves as the entry point for the application and is responsible for setting up the hosting environment, configuring services, and starting the application.

Here's the typical role of the `Program.cs` file in an ASP.NET Core application:

1. **Define the Main Method**:
   The `Main` method is the entry point for the application. It sets up the web host builder and starts the ASP.NET Core application.

   ```csharp
   public class Program
   {
       public static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
       }

       public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
           Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
               .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
               {
                   webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
               });
   }
   ```

2. **Create the Host**:
   The `CreateHostBuilder` method is responsible for creating an instance of the web host builder. It configures the web host builder with default settings, such as environment variables, configuration sources, logging, and dependency injection.

3. **Configure Web Host**:
   The `ConfigureWebHostDefaults` method configures the web host builder with defaults for hosting an ASP.NET Core web application. It specifies the startup class (`Startup`) that configures the application's request processing pipeline.

4. **Specify Startup Class**:
   The `Startup` class is responsible for configuring the application's middleware pipeline, services, and request handling. It contains methods such as `ConfigureServices` and `Configure`, which are used to configure services and request processing middleware, respectively.

   ```csharp
   public class Startup
   {
       public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
       {
           // Configure services
       }

       public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
       {
           // Configure middleware pipeline
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Configure Application Services**:
   Inside the `Startup` class, the `ConfigureServices` method is used to configure services such as MVC, Entity Framework, authentication, authorization, logging, etc. These services are registered with the built-in dependency injection container.

6. **Configure Middleware Pipeline**:
   The `Configure` method in the `Startup` class is used to configure the middleware pipeline for request processing. Middleware components are added to the pipeline in the order they are specified, and they handle incoming HTTP requests and responses.

Overall, the `Program.cs` file in an ASP.NET Core application sets up the hosting environment, configures the web host, and specifies the startup class responsible for configuring the application's services and middleware pipeline. It serves as the entry point for the application and is essential for bootstrapping the ASP.NET Core application.
 

## ASP.NET Core Minimal Code API

An ASP.NET Core Minimal API is a lightweight approach to building web APIs with minimal ceremony and less boilerplate code. Introduced in ASP.NET Core 6, Minimal APIs aim to streamline the development process by providing a concise syntax for defining routes, handling requests, and returning responses with minimal setup.

Here's what Minimal API in ASP.NET Core means:

1. **Reduced Boilerplate**:
   Minimal APIs eliminate much of the boilerplate code traditionally associated with building ASP.NET Core applications. They offer a simplified syntax that allows developers to define routes, handle requests, and return responses with minimal ceremony.

2. **Concise Routing**:
   Minimal APIs use a concise routing syntax that allows developers to define routes inline within the application code. This eliminates the need for separate route configuration files or controllers, making the routing logic more straightforward and easier to understand.

3. **Lambda-based Handlers**:
   Handlers for HTTP requests are defined using lambda expressions or inline functions, rather than separate controller classes and action methods. This reduces the overhead of creating controller classes and encourages a more functional programming style.

4. **Built-in Dependency Injection**:
   Minimal APIs support built-in dependency injection for services and dependencies. Services can be registered and resolved directly within the application code, simplifying the setup process and promoting code reusability.

5. **Self-contained Applications**:
   Minimal APIs enable developers to create self-contained web applications with fewer moving parts. They are well-suited for building lightweight microservices, serverless applications, or small-scale APIs that don't require the full MVC framework.

6. **Improved Performance**:
   By minimizing the amount of code and infrastructure required to handle requests, Minimal APIs can improve the performance and scalability of ASP.NET Core applications. They reduce the overhead of middleware processing and routing, resulting in faster response times and lower resource consumption.

Overall, Minimal APIs in ASP.NET Core offer a more lightweight and streamlined approach to building web APIs, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than boilerplate code. They are particularly well-suited for small to medium-sized applications, prototypes, or APIs where simplicity and speed of development are paramount.


In ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, the `app.MapGet` method is used to define an HTTP GET endpoint for handling incoming requests. This method is part of the `IApplicationBuilder` interface and is typically used within the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class to define routes and endpoints for handling HTTP requests.

Here's how you can use `app.MapGet` in a Minimal API application:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", async context =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello, World!");
});

app.Run();
```

In this example:

- `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` creates a builder instance for configuring the application.
- `var app = builder.Build()` builds the application from the builder instance.
- `app.MapGet("/", async context => { ... })` defines a route for handling HTTP GET requests to the root path ("/"). Inside the lambda expression, you specify the logic for handling the request and generating the response. In this case, it simply writes "Hello, World!" to the response stream.
- `app.Run()` runs the application.

You can define multiple `app.MapGet` (or `app.MapPost`, `app.MapPut`, etc.) statements to handle different routes and HTTP methods within the same application. This allows you to define your API endpoints with a minimal amount of code, without the need for controllers or separate route configuration files.


In ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, the `app.MapPost` method is used to define an HTTP POST endpoint for handling incoming requests. This method is part of the `IApplicationBuilder` interface and is typically used within the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class to define routes and endpoints for handling HTTP requests.

Here's how you can use `app.MapPost` in a Minimal API application:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapPost("/api/data", async context =>
{
    // Handle the incoming POST request
    var requestBody = await new StreamReader(context.Request.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
    
    // Process the request body

    // Return a response
    context.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Data received successfully!");
});

app.Run();
```

In this example:

- `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` creates a builder instance for configuring the application.
- `var app = builder.Build()` builds the application from the builder instance.
- `app.MapPost("/api/data", async context => { ... })` defines a route for handling HTTP POST requests to the "/api/data" endpoint. Inside the lambda expression, you specify the logic for handling the request and generating the response. In this case, it reads the request body, processes the data (which you would implement according to your application's requirements), and returns a simple response.
- `app.Run()` runs the application.

You can define multiple `app.MapPost` (or `app.MapGet`, `app.MapPut`, etc.) statements to handle different routes and HTTP methods within the same application. This allows you to define your API endpoints with a minimal amount of code, without the need for controllers or separate route configuration files.



In ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs, the `app.MapPut` method is used to define an HTTP PUT endpoint for handling incoming requests. This method is part of the `IApplicationBuilder` interface and is typically used within the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class to define routes and endpoints for handling HTTP requests.

Here's how you can use `app.MapPut` in a Minimal API application:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapPut("/api/data/{id}", async context =>
{
    // Retrieve the 'id' from the route parameters
    var id = context.Request.RouteValues["id"] as string;

    // Handle the incoming PUT request
    var requestBody = await new StreamReader(context.Request.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
    
    // Process the request body and update the resource with the specified 'id'

    // Return a response
    context.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
    await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Data with ID '{id}' updated successfully!");
});

app.Run();
```

In this example:

- `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` creates a builder instance for configuring the application.
- `var app = builder.Build()` builds the application from the builder instance.
- `app.MapPut("/api/data/{id}", async context => { ... })` defines a route for handling HTTP PUT requests to the "/api/data/{id}" endpoint, where `{id}` is a route parameter representing the identifier of the resource to be updated. Inside the lambda expression, you specify the logic for handling the request and generating the response. In this case, it reads the request body, processes the data, updates the resource with the specified ID, and returns a simple response.
- `app.Run()` runs the application.

You can define multiple `app.MapPut` (or `app.MapGet`, `app.MapPost`, etc.) statements to handle different routes and HTTP methods within the same application. This allows you to define your API endpoints with a minimal amount of code, without the need for controllers or separate route configuration files.


## ASP.NET CORE  app.Run Method

In ASP.NET Core, the `app.Run` method is used to configure a terminal middleware component that will handle the request if no other middleware in the pipeline produces a response. It's typically the last middleware added to the pipeline and serves as a fallback mechanism to handle requests that haven't been handled by earlier middleware components.

Here's how you can use `app.Run` in an ASP.NET Core application:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure middleware components
app.UseRouting();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    // Configure endpoint routing
    endpoints.MapGet("/", async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello, World!");
    });

    // Add more endpoints as needed...
});

// Configure terminal middleware using app.Run
app.Run(async context =>
{
    // Handle requests that haven't been handled by earlier middleware
    context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status404NotFound;
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("404 - Not Found");
});

app.Run();
```

In this example:

- `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` creates a builder instance for configuring the application.
- `var app = builder.Build()` builds the application from the builder instance.
- Middleware components such as routing (`app.UseRouting`) and endpoint routing (`app.UseEndpoints`) are configured before `app.Run`.
- Inside `app.UseEndpoints`, you define the endpoints for handling specific routes and HTTP methods. These endpoints use lambda expressions to specify the logic for handling requests.
- `app.Run` is used to configure a terminal middleware component that handles requests that haven't been handled by earlier middleware components. In this case, it returns a "404 - Not Found" response for any unmatched requests.

`app.Run` is a useful mechanism for providing fallback behavior or handling requests that haven't been handled by earlier middleware components. It's commonly used to define global error handling, logging, or to serve default responses for unmatched requests.






## Entity Framework

Entity Framework (EF) is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework developed by Microsoft for .NET applications. It enables developers to work with relational databases using .NET objects, eliminating the need for writing tedious SQL queries manually. Instead, developers can use C# or Visual Basic.NET code to interact with the database, making database operations more intuitive and less error-prone.

Here are some key features and components of Entity Framework:

1. **Entity Data Model (EDM)**:
   - The Entity Data Model is a conceptual model that represents the structure of data in a database. It defines entities (classes) and their relationships.
   - Entities in the EDM correspond to tables in the database, and properties of entities correspond to columns in the tables.

2. **LINQ to Entities**:
   - LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) to Entities allows developers to write queries against the Entity Data Model using LINQ syntax.
   - LINQ queries are strongly-typed and checked at compile-time, providing type safety and IntelliSense support in IDEs like Visual Studio.

3. **Code First, Database First, and Model First Approaches**:
   - Entity Framework supports multiple approaches to creating the Entity Data Model:
     - **Code First**: Developers define entity classes in code, and the database schema is generated based on these classes.
     - **Database First**: Developers start with an existing database, and Entity Framework generates entity classes and the Entity Data Model based on the database schema.
     - **Model First**: Developers define the Entity Data Model visually using a designer tool, and Entity Framework generates database schema and entity classes based on the model.

4. **Automatic Change Tracking**:
   - Entity Framework automatically tracks changes made to entity objects and generates the necessary SQL statements to persist those changes to the database.
   - This simplifies data manipulation by handling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations transparently.

5. **Lazy Loading and Eager Loading**:
   - Entity Framework supports lazy loading, where related entities are loaded from the database only when accessed for the first time.
   - Eager loading allows developers to specify which related entities to load along with the main entity, reducing the number of database round-trips.

6. **Database Providers**:
   - Entity Framework supports multiple database providers, including SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others.
   - Providers are responsible for translating LINQ queries and other operations into database-specific SQL syntax.

Overall, Entity Framework simplifies database access and manipulation in .NET applications, providing a powerful and flexible ORM solution for developers. It promotes rapid development, reduces boilerplate code, and improves code maintainability.



Entity Framework (EF) Core is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework provided by Microsoft for .NET Core applications. It simplifies the process of interacting with relational databases by enabling developers to work with database objects using .NET objects, eliminating the need for writing tedious SQL queries. Here's how you can use Entity Framework Core in your C# .NET Core applications:

1. **Install Entity Framework Core**:
   
   First, you need to install the Entity Framework Core package in your project using NuGet Package Manager or the .NET CLI.

   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
   ```

   This command installs the Entity Framework Core SQL Server provider. You can replace `SqlServer` with the appropriate provider for your database (e.g., `MySql`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`, etc.).

2. **Create DbContext Class**:

   Next, create a class that derives from `DbContext`. This class represents the database context and provides access to Entity Framework Core features.

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

   public class MyDbContext : DbContext
   {
       public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }

       protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
       {
           optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("YourConnectionString");
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Define Entity Classes**:

   Define your entity classes, which represent tables in your database. Each property in the class represents a column in the corresponding table.

   ```csharp
   public class Customer
   {
       public int Id { get; set; }
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public string Email { get; set; }
   }
   ```

4. **Perform CRUD Operations**:

   You can now use Entity Framework Core to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your database.

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Linq;

   class Program
   {
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
           using (var context = new MyDbContext())
           {
               // Add new customer
               var newCustomer = new Customer { Name = "John Doe", Email = "john@example.com" };
               context.Customers.Add(newCustomer);
               context.SaveChanges();

               // Retrieve customers
               var customers = context.Customers.ToList();
               foreach (var customer in customers)
               {
                   Console.WriteLine($"Customer: {customer.Name}, Email: {customer.Email}");
               }

               // Update customer
               var customerToUpdate = context.Customers.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Name == "John Doe");
               if (customerToUpdate != null)
               {
                   customerToUpdate.Email = "john.doe@example.com";
                   context.SaveChanges();
               }

               // Delete customer
               var customerToDelete = context.Customers.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Name == "John Doe");
               if (customerToDelete != null)
               {
                   context.Customers.Remove(customerToDelete);
                   context.SaveChanges();
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Migration and Database Setup**:

   Entity Framework Core supports migrations to manage database schema changes. You can create migrations using the `dotnet ef migrations` command and apply them using the `dotnet ef database update` command.

   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

This is a basic overview of using Entity Framework Core in C# .NET Core applications. Entity Framework Core simplifies database interactions and provides a powerful ORM solution for .NET Core development.


The Data First approach in Entity Framework is a development workflow where developers start by designing the database schema using visual design tools or by writing SQL scripts. Once the database schema is defined, Entity Framework generates entity classes and a corresponding Entity Data Model (EDM) based on the database schema. Developers can then use these generated classes to interact with the database in their .NET application.

Here's an overview of the Data First approach workflow:

1. **Design Database Schema**:
   Developers design the database schema using visual design tools provided by database management systems (DBMS) such as SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench, or third-party tools. Alternatively, developers can write SQL scripts to create database tables, relationships, and constraints.

2. **Generate Entity Model**:
   Once the database schema is designed, developers use Entity Framework's scaffolding or reverse engineering tools to generate entity classes and an Entity Data Model (EDM) based on the database schema. Entity Framework examines the database schema and creates corresponding entity classes for each table, along with properties representing columns, and navigation properties representing relationships between tables.

3. **Use Generated Entity Classes**:
   Developers use the generated entity classes in their .NET application to interact with the database. They can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using LINQ to Entities or LINQ queries against the generated entity classes.

4. **Customization and Extension**:
   Developers can customize and extend the generated entity classes by adding additional properties, methods, or attributes as needed. They can also use Data Annotations or Fluent API to configure mappings, relationships, and other aspects of the entity model.

5. **Update Database Schema**:
   If changes are made to the database schema, developers can use Entity Framework's migration feature to update the database schema without losing data. Migrations allow for incremental updates to the database schema while preserving existing data.

The Data First approach is suitable for scenarios where the database schema is already defined or where developers prefer to work with a visual representation of the database schema. It provides a straightforward way to integrate existing databases with .NET applications and facilitates collaboration between database designers and application developers. However, it may lead to tighter coupling between the database schema and the application, as changes to the database schema may require corresponding changes to the generated entity classes.


## When to use Data First Approach

The Data First approach in Entity Framework is suitable for various scenarios where the database schema is already established or where developers prefer to design the database schema visually before implementing the application logic. Here are some situations where the Data First approach is commonly used:

1. **Legacy Systems Integration**:
   When working with existing databases or legacy systems that already have a defined database schema, the Data First approach allows developers to generate entity classes and interact with the database without modifying the existing schema.

2. **Collaborative Development**:
   In projects involving collaboration between database designers and application developers, the Data First approach enables database designers to define the schema using visual design tools, while developers focus on implementing the application logic using the generated entity classes.

3. **Rapid Prototyping**:
   For rapid prototyping or proof-of-concept projects, the Data First approach allows developers to quickly generate entity classes and start building the application without spending time designing the database schema manually.

4. **Schema Evolution**:
   In scenarios where the database schema evolves over time or requires frequent modifications, the Data First approach facilitates updating the entity model and database schema using Entity Framework's migration feature without losing data.

5. **Database-Centric Applications**:
   For applications where the database plays a central role and the focus is primarily on data storage and retrieval, the Data First approach provides a straightforward way to integrate the application with the existing database infrastructure.

6. **Visual Design Preference**:
   Some developers prefer to design the database schema visually using tools like SQL Server Management Studio or MySQL Workbench. The Data First approach accommodates this preference by allowing developers to generate entity classes from the visual representation of the database schema.

Overall, the Data First approach is useful in scenarios where the database schema is already established, collaboration between database designers and application developers is required, or rapid development and prototyping are priorities. It provides a convenient way to integrate existing databases with .NET applications and facilitates seamless interaction between the application and the underlying data storage.



The Code First approach in Entity Framework is a development workflow that allows developers to define the entity model using plain C# or VB.NET classes without having to design the database schema first. Instead of starting with a database and generating entity classes and mappings from it, developers start by defining their entity classes and relationships in code. The database schema is then automatically generated from these classes when the application is run or during a migration process.

Here's an overview of the Code First approach workflow:

1. **Define Entity Classes**:
   Developers define entity classes using plain C# or VB.NET. Each entity class typically represents a table in the database, and each property in the class corresponds to a column in the table.

   ```csharp
   public class Product
   {
       public int ProductId { get; set; }
       public string Name { get; set; }
       public decimal Price { get; set; }
   }
   ```

2. **Define Relationships**:
   Developers define relationships between entities using navigation properties. These properties represent associations between entities, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships.

   ```csharp
   public class Order
   {
       public int OrderId { get; set; }
       public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }

       public virtual ICollection<Product> Products { get; set; }
   }
   ```

3. **Configure Entity Model**:
   Developers can further configure the entity model using Data Annotations or Fluent API to specify additional details such as primary keys, foreign keys, column names, data types, constraints, etc.

   ```csharp
   using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;

   [Table("Products")]
   public class Product
   {
       [Key]
       public int ProductId { get; set; }

       [Column("ProductName")]
       public string Name { get; set; }
       
       // Other properties...
   }
   ```

4. **Initialize Database Context**:
   Developers create a DbContext class that represents the database context. This class typically contains DbSet properties for each entity class, representing database tables.

   ```csharp
   public class MyDbContext : DbContext
   {
       public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
       public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }
   }
   ```

5. **Database Initialization**:
   Developers can choose how the database is initialized when the application starts. Entity Framework supports various database initialization strategies, such as DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges, CreateDatabaseIfNotExists, and MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion.

6. **Migrations (Optional)**:
   If database changes are required after the initial creation, developers can use migrations to manage database schema changes. Migrations allow for incremental updates to the database schema without losing data.

The Code First approach provides flexibility and agility in development, allowing developers to focus on designing the application's domain model without being constrained by the database schema. It promotes a more natural object-oriented approach to data modeling and facilitates rapid application development.

## When to use Code First Approach

The Code First approach in Entity Framework is beneficial in various scenarios, particularly when you want more control over the domain model and prefer to define it using code rather than starting with an existing database schema. Here are some situations where the Code First approach is commonly used:

1. **Greenfield Projects**:
   When starting a new project from scratch and there's no existing database schema, the Code First approach allows developers to define the domain model using code. This approach is often preferred as it promotes a more natural object-oriented design without being constrained by an existing database schema.

2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**:
   In projects following Domain-Driven Design principles, the Code First approach aligns well with the concept of designing the domain model based on the business requirements. Developers can define entity classes, value objects, aggregates, and relationships directly in code, reflecting the domain model more accurately.

3. **Agile Development**:
   For Agile development methodologies where requirements evolve rapidly, the Code First approach provides flexibility by allowing developers to iteratively design and refine the domain model in code. Changes to the domain model can be easily accommodated without worrying about database schema changes upfront.

4. **Prototyping and Rapid Development**:
   In scenarios where quick prototyping or rapid development is required, the Code First approach enables developers to get started quickly by defining the domain model in code. This approach minimizes the need for upfront planning and allows developers to focus on implementing functionality rather than database schema design.

5. **Testing and TDD (Test-Driven Development)**:
   The Code First approach facilitates testing and Test-Driven Development practices by allowing developers to create in-memory databases or use lightweight databases for testing purposes. Developers can define mock or test-specific data contexts to isolate the tests from the actual database.

6. **Microservices Architecture**:
   In microservices architecture, where each service has its own database schema and data model, the Code First approach allows developers to define the domain model independently for each service. This promotes loose coupling between services and facilitates service autonomy.

7. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   The Code First approach works well in CI/CD pipelines, where changes to the domain model can trigger automated database migrations. This allows for seamless integration and deployment of changes without manual intervention.

Overall, the Code First approach is suitable for scenarios where you want more control over the domain model, prefer a code-centric development workflow, and value flexibility, agility, and maintainability in your application design.
